	// just for test, we are going to voxelize the scene 60 units in each direction. Here we are dividing the world position of the vertex by 1/30, which means
	// that components between -30 and 30 will me mapped to NDC [-1, 1]. In the geometry shader we are going to pass this position along to the fragment shader
	// in another variable (because we have to orthographically project gl_position on its dominant axis in order to maximize the number of fragments generated 
	// per triangle so that the triangles fill as many voxels as possible). Since the world coordinate below is going to be transferred to another variable before 
	// being passed along to the fragment shader, it is not going to be clipped automatically by opengl, this means that we will have to clip it manually in the 
	// fragment shader. After manually clipping the fragment's interpolated world position, we convert it to the [0, 1] range and divide the 3d texture's dimensions
	// by it. We will use that value to index voxels in the 3d texture and inject lighting information into them.
